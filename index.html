                Final Year Project:</h2>
            <h6>Bike Rental: </h6>
            <p>This My College Final Year Project, The main motto of this project is help the customer to take Bike’s on
                rent. When we go on any trip
                outside the town or country we want to be free of time so instead of going through metros or taxis
                we
                can prefer to have own vehicle for rent. Using this system customer can only take bike by going to
                the
                address provide and the vehicle owner can know the address that a customer is verified or not. The
                admin
                can only posting and editing bike details.He/She can post any details regarding bike’s. If the need
                bike
                rent he/she must book vehicle before two days from the date he wants, also the user has to mention
                the
                duration for how many day he want bike on rent, then admin has the control to approve the order else
                cancel.
                <br>
                In that Project I used Technlogies like HTML CSS Bootstrap JavaScript, as Front end it was done by
                Me on
                the other hand which backend was done by one of my friend and the Project language was PHP
